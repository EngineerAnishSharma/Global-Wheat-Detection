Wheat Detection Using YOLO is a project designed to identify and highlight wheat grains in images using the YOLO object detection model. It provides an easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit, where users can upload images and instantly view results with bounding boxes marking the detected wheat.

The project is efficient, customizable, and works on local machines or cloud setups, making it accessible for farmers, researchers, and agricultural professionals. It has applications in crop analysis, yield estimation, and quality control, with future potential to support real-time video analysis and expanded object detection for pests or diseases.

This solution bridges advanced technology and practical needs, making it simple and impactful.
